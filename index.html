  <h5>Sacramento Food Bank</h5>
<h4>In the past, I dedicated a lot of my time to volunteering at my local food bank. It made me feel so content that all of my labor was going directly towards the less fortunate. Sacramento Food Bank has been in need of donations now more than ever. </h4>

<h5>WEAVE Inc</h5>
<h4>WEAVE is a large organization that assists victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, stalking, human trafficking, etc. I had the pleasure of working with WEAVE Sacramento during my internship at the county public health department. I lost a family friend to domestic violence in January 2020, so choosing this charity is my way of honoring her memory.</h4>

<h5>Shriners Hospital for Children</h5>
<h4>Donating to children's hospitals has always been a big part of my life. When I was in elementary school, I sold handmade jewelry and raised enough money to donate teddy bears to underprivileged children's hospitals in Washington, DC. This may not be the same as donating teddy bears again, but it's still a step in the right direction.</h4>
